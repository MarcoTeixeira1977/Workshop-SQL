# Intro to SQL for Querying Databases

**This workshop is under development. It should be complete before Nov. 6, 2019.**  The goal is to write a workshop that teaches the basics of (non-spatial) SQL using DB Browsesr and SQLite.

This workshop provides an overview of the utility and base SQL commands for working with data in a relational database. Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions, and combining data from separate tables. 

## Goals
After this workshop learners should be able to:
 * Perform common SQL commands including sorting, filtering, calculating values, aggregating, combining data, and basic data cleaning (i.e. replace missing values).
 * Combine commands to construct a query to answer a specific question.
 * Identify the benefits of working with SQL.
 * Access additional resources for using SQL in other software like R.

## Prereqs
No prior programming experience is necessary. Bring your laptop with SQLite installed (http://www.sqlitetutorial.net/download-install-sqlite/) and running.

# Getting Setup

## Install the Software

We'll be using [DB Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), a free, open source, graphical interface for working with SQL databases that works on all major computing operating systems. Installers are available on their [Downloads Page](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).  If you do not have install permissions on your computer, the Portable App version may work without administrator permissions.
